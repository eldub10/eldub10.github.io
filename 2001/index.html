<h3><center>BridgePort</center></h3>
<hr size="1" color="Gray"><br>

<a href="http://www.supertracks.com/products/productinfo/product_info.asp" target="_top">BridgePort</a>&trade; is Supertracks' last-element streaming technology that delivers locally repeatable music in a single stream from cached, secure music files. This delivery method creates a cost-effective way to deliver mainstream music over the Internet, while providing higher, CD-quality music playback. It also enables new advertising and promotion models incorporating demographic targeting and detailed tracking.<br>
<br>
The BridgePort platform is a modular design utilizing a framework architecture based on the Component Object Model (COM). Component DLLs were created in C++ using ATL. User interface components were created in Visual Basic and DHTML.<br>
<br>
The platform was designed to accommodate prospective features and security requirements; support for new content usage requirements can be added dynamically. BridgePort's asynchronous data collection method provides all of the advantages of a rich central database without creating the latency problems typically associated with back-end data processing. The BridgePort architecture contains multiple levels of security and encryption technologies designed to protect copyright holders and to comply with the legal requirements of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The BridgePort platform extends the content distribution network to its final element &#151; the home PC. Utilizing the processing power and local drive capacity in today's PCs, BridgePort is well suited to address the capacity, administration, and bandwidth issues facing conventional streaming systems.<br>
<br>
This product was distributed in a public beta called <a href="http://www.jamplayer.net" target="_top">Jam Player</a> in conjunction with Portland radio station Jammin 95.5, and also in another program with HipHopSite called <a href="http://www.xtuner.com" target="_top">XTuner</a>.<br>

<!-- RTrack -->
<h3><center>RTrack</center></h3>
<hr size="1" color="Gray"><br>

RTrack&trade; is Supertracks' Business-to-Business digital distribution of music (DDM) system that allows online retailers the ability to sell music from Supertracks' digital warehouse. This system can be described as a multi-step process that begins with the automated delivery of the product catalog. The data is delivered in XML format, using HTTP, to retailers for incorporation into their databases. Retailers make these products available for purchase using their existing e-commerce systems. When a retailer's customer purchases an item, a purchase transaction is sent to Supertracks (in XML format) using HTTPS with mutual authentication. Supertracks handles these requests in real-time using ISAPI extensions and COM components that record the transaction in a SQL Server database using OLEDB. A license is generated for the purchased music and a link is sent back to the retailer, who displays it to the end user. When the end user clicks on the link in their browser, the music is downloaded from Supertracks' digital warehouse to the end user's computer and unlocked using the associated license.<br>
<br>
Strategic partners in this project were Microsoft, Preview Systems, eMusic, HMV, Virgin Megastores, EMI, and TVT.<br>

<td>This project was a partnership between Supertracks, Preview Systems, Intel, Urocket (a subsidiary of NEC/Packard Bell), and EMI Music. Supertracks developed a micro-payment system for music called the <a href="http://www.internetmusiccard.com/" target="_top">Internet Music Card</a> (IMC). These cards were bundled with home music studio PCs by NEC/Packard Bell. Music provided by EMI was sold through the <a href="http://www.urocketmusic.com/">Urocket</a> music portal. Web-based delivery was developed using  Active Server Pages (ASP), business logic components that access a SQL Server database, and Site Server e-commerce components.

The game simulates computer networking environments and allows users to experiment with installation, configuration, management, troubleshooting, and other networking processes. Additional components of the game also simulate the network operating system's desktop environment. The game architecture consists of a graphics engine programmed in C++ using DirectX, a logic engine that draws scenarios from a database of operating system rules, software properties, and hardware configurations, and a desktop simulator consisting of components built from resource templates that mimic a graphical user interface. This provides an extremely realistic simulation of the operating system environment.<br></td>
